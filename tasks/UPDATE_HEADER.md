# Task: Update Header Title for Project Detail Page

## Objective
Modify the application to display the project name as the title in the Header component when a user navigates to the ProjectDetail page.

## Requirements
1. The Header component should display the project name instead of the default title when viewing a project's details.
2. The title should update dynamically as the user navigates between different projects.
3. Ensure that the title reverts to its default value when navigating away from the ProjectDetail page.
